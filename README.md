# Push Swap Project

The Push swap project challenges developers to implement efficient sorting algorithms (for me it's BEST MOVE) using stacks and a set of instructions.

## Instructions

- Write a sorting algorithm in C, adhering to specified rules.
- Implement a program named `push_swap` to sort a stack with the smallest number of operations.
- Bonus part includes creating a `checker` program to validate sorting instructions.

## Usage

- Use `push_swap` to sort integers with minimal operations.
- Execute `checker` to validate sorting instructions.

## Conclusion

The Push swap project sharpens C programming skills and reinforces understanding of algorithm complexity. By implementing efficient sorting algorithms, developers gain valuable insights into optimization techniques and algorithm design.
